# Data Structures

Dynamic Arrays
* Allocated memory at runtime and the memory is allocated from heap.
* Neither size nor type of data held are predetermined.
* Arrays in scripting languages (e.g. Python, JavaScript) are implemented as dynamic arrays.

Fixed / Compile-Time Arrays
* Allocated memory at compile time and the memory is allocated as part of a functions stack frame.
