# Stacks

## Stack Implementations

### Linked-List

### Resizing Array

## Tradeoffs

Linked-List Implementation:
* Every operation takes constant time in the WORST case.
* Uses extra time and space to deal with the links.

Resizing-Array Implementation:
* Every operation takes constant AMORTIZED time.
* Less wasted space.
